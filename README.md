# Olympic 2024 Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the **Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games** dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes **data profiling** for detailed summaries and **interactive visualizations** to make data exploration intuitive and engaging.

## Key Features

- **Data Profiling**: Generate comprehensive statistical summaries to understand the dataset.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create charts that allow for dynamic interaction and in-depth exploration of key metrics like athlete performance, medal counts, and more.
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Analyze the distribution of athletes' performance, medal tallies by country, and athlete demographics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset provides detailed information on the **Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games**, including:

- Athlete demographics (age, gender, nationality)
- Event details (sport categories, competition dates)
- Medal counts by athlete and country
- Event locations and schedules

## Prerequisites

To replicate this analysis, the following tools and libraries are required:

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: Static visualizations.
- **plotly**: For creating interactive and responsive charts.
- **pandas-profiling**: Generate a detailed data profiling report.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the analysis in an interactive environment.

 

## Data Profiling

**Data profiling** is performed to understand the dataset in depth. This step includes:

- Summary statistics for all variables (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
- Identification of missing values and data type inconsistencies.
- Correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
- Data quality checks and insights into feature distributions.

The data profiling report provides a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process begins with data cleaning and descriptive statistics, followed by a series of visualizations:

- **Medal Distribution by Country**: Analyze which countries are leading in medal tallies.
- **Athlete Performance**: Examine top-performing athletes and their accomplishments.
- **Demographics**: Explore the age and gender distribution of athletes participating in the games.

## Interactive Visualizations

To enhance data exploration, we use **interactive visualizations** with Plotly, making it easier to explore the dataset dynamically. Key visualizations include:

- **Medal Distribution Bar Charts**: View and compare countries' performances interactively.
- **Age Distribution Histograms**: See the age range of athletes across sports.
- **Scatter Plots**: Display medal winners and their performance across different sports categories.

These visualizations allow users to zoom, filter, and interact with the dataset for deeper insights.

## Conclusion

This **Olympic 2024 Data Analysis** project provides a thorough examination of athlete performance and country achievements. The combination of **data profiling** and **interactive charts** offers an intuitive way to explore the dataset and uncover valuable insights. Key findings about athlete demographics and medal trends help inform future predictions and analyses.

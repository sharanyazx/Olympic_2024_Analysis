Data Profiling
We perform data profiling to understand the dataset's overall structure, data quality, and key statistics. This includes:

Generating summary statistics for numerical columns.
Identifying missing values and data types.
Exploring correlations between different variables.
Visualizing distributions for key features.
Providing an overall data quality report for deeper insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves cleaning the data, addressing missing values, and ensuring proper formatting of the data. Some key analyses include:

Descriptive statistics: A summary of the data to understand general trends.
Medal distribution by country: Analyzing which countries are leading in medal counts.
Athlete performance: Investigating top-performing athletes and their achievements.
Age and gender distribution: Understanding the demographic composition of athletes.
Interactive Visualizations
The project utilizes interactive visualizations to dynamically explore the data. These visualizations allow users to interact with the data, zoom in on specific aspects, and filter based on various criteria. Examples include:

Bar charts showing the medal distribution across countries.
Histograms displaying the age distribution of athletes.
Scatter plots showcasing top-performing athletes and their medal counts.
These charts provide an intuitive way to uncover hidden trends and patterns in the dataset.

Conclusion
This analysis of the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games dataset offers valuable insights into the performance of athletes and countries. The interactive charts make data exploration more accessible, while data profiling provides a solid foundation for further analysis. Key trends such as country dominance in specific sports and athlete demographics can be easily identified.
